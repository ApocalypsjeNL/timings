Aikar's Minecraft Timings Viewer
=======

This is the system behind <http://timings.aikar.co/> that processes timing reports.
This code base is primarily targeting Timings v2, currently in development for Spigot.

If you can think of something to improve the system please feel free to PR it.

This project intends to support Sponge in the future too, or any project implementing the "Aikar Timings System" starting with v2. 

Contributing
======
Note: I am currently rewriting this system to get rid of all the old hack-job code.

so PR's need to wait until I'm done.

Timings File Format
======
This file format is still subject to rapid change, so please do not try to parse any preview I've given for production use!

License
======
The project is licensed under MIT as I'm a "I don't care" type of person usually, but I'd really prefer if clones did not start up for no good reason.

Remember: [when to fork](http://jamesdixon.wordpress.com/forking-protocol-why-when-and-how-to-fork-an-open-source-project/).

I'm totally open to any reasonable improvement. So if you think it can be better, talk to me on Spigot or Esper IRC and PR :)

If I disappear from Minecraft, then please keep this tool alive!
